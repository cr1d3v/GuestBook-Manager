GuestBook Manager v2 – Planning Notes

Project Type: Console Application (.NET Framework)

Target Framework: 4.7.2

Solution Name: GuestBookManagerV2

Main Project:
-------------
Project Name: ConsoleUI
Purpose: Core console application that handles execution flow, user input, and output formatting.

Class Library:
--------------
Project Name: GuestBookLibrary
Purpose: Contains reusable models and logic classes to separate concerns and promote modularity.

Namespaces:
-----------
- ConsoleUI
- GuestBookLibrary.Models

Key Goals:
----------
- Practice modular programming using multiple files and projects.
- Learn to use custom classes (e.g., GuestModel) and pass objects between methods.
- Follow SOLID principles, especially SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Add exception handling for better error resilience.
- Build a more readable and user-friendly console UI.
- Prepare the project structure for future enhancements (e.g., saving data to files or databases).

Key Files:
----------
- Program.cs → Entry point, manages main application flow
- GetGuestInfo.cs → Handles all user input (names, guest count, messages)
- ConsoleMessages.cs → Displays output to the user (intro, final summary)
- GuestModel.cs → Custom model storing guest-related data with validation logic

Planned Features:
-----------------
- Collect guest names and number of guests in each party
- Validate all input (letters only for names, number range: 1–50)
- Allow guests to leave a custom message
- Display a summary of all guests and the total count
- Use exception handling for robust input logic

Version Notes:
--------------
This is an improved version of the original "Mini Guest Book App (v1)".
v2 introduces object-oriented programming, input validation, better UI formatting, and an overall cleaner architecture.
