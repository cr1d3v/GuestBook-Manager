My Thought Nr1:
After line 3, where the user is asked if more guests are coming, there is no line break. As a result, the text appears cluttered and difficult to read. To improve readability, I decided to add 1 Console.WriteLine() statement to create spacing between each input. This helps separate the prompts and makes the output look cleaner and more user-friendly.

My Thought Nr2:
Only the total number of guests is captured, while the individual number of guests per family is not recorded. Initially, this seemed incorrect to me. However, since the project requirements do not specify the need to track each family's guest count separately, I decided to leave it as is.
