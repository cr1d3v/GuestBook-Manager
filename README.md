## The Project Idea
A simple C# project to practice software design and programming principles.

**GuestBook Manager** is a lightweight project designed as a learning tool to refine and experiment with C# concepts. 
It serves as a practical exercise for revisiting key programming principles and improving software design practices.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) â€“ A general-purpose programming language designed by Microsoft.
- **Framework:** .NET 6
- **Architecture:** Two-class structure:
  - **Main Class:** `Program.cs` â€“ Handles execution flow.
  - **Logic Class:** `GuestBookLogic.cs` â€“ Contains core logic and operations.

## Key Features & Concepts

- **Methods:** Utilizes parameters, return values, and tuples.
- **Design Principles:**
  - **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Code is structured to avoid redundancy.
  - **SOLID (Single-Responsibility Principle):** Ensures maintainable and modular code.
- **Core Programming Constructs:** Lists, loops, variables, and conditional statements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into **three main folders** for clarity and maintainability:

1. **Planning:** Contains a `.txt` document outlining the application's design and logic.
2. **Execution:** Houses the main application files.
3. **Testing:** Stores test cases and execution logs for verifying functionality.
